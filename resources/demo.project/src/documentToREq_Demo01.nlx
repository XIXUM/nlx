1.1 First Sub Chapter

That's the first subchapter that will be organized in the hierarchy under the Main chapter.
You can even make Links to other chapters like this (1.0). Then the subchapter has a crosslink to that chapter 1.0

What's also supported is: "quotes", all sorts of (Bracked sentences) with [Squared brackets as well]

2.0 Second Main Chapter

Another chapter. Here we can show that NLX also understands:
Integer numbers: 1 2 3
English float numbers: 1.254
German float numbers 1,254
and even units like 5,5 m and currency 100,00$ and 200â‚¬
This chapter has another Link to the Subchapter (1.1)
And this is a dead reference (3.34)
There are also some intrinsic grammar checks implemented. if you start a sentence w.o. capital letter a warning will show up.

Enjoy!
